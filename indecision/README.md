Learning React via Udemy for #100DaysOfCode

Initially, I'll be continuing this Udemy course:

https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/

After getting through all that, I'll be building a WebApp to display metrics from @rudedog's solar panels in Moville. We've already done the work to store the data from the solar setup into a MongoDB instance running on the farm, so only the Front End is left. I'll probably use Highcharts to start with for visualizations and then look into something like D3 if I need more customization.
